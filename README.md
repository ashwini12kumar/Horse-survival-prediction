# Horse-survival-prediction (using Decision Tree & Random Forest)
Predicting the fate of horse given its medical condition

Here, we use two classification algorithms: Decision Tree and Random Forest, to predict the fate of any horse, given it's medical conditions. There are a lot of missing values in the dataset, both numerical and categorical, which needs to be dealt with before fitting in the models.
